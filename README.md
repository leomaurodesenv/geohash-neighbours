"A geohash is a convenient way of expressing a location (anywhere in the world) using a short alphanumeric string, with greater precision obtained with longer strings" by [Geohashes](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.html).  

This repository presents a public interface for testing and interact with geohash based on latitude and longitude. Also, how to compute, in _O(1)_, their neighbours' geohashes. See [online](http://projects.leonardomauro.com/geohash-neighbours/).
